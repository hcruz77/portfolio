## Description
This is my official professional portfolio. There is a header component that appears on multiple pages, a navigation component that is used to conditionally render the different pages of the portfolio, a footer that appears on multiple pages, and a project component that is used to render the images and links to the deployed applications on Github.

## Technology
Along with React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components were used to build the format of the front end. The application was deployed for the first time on Github pages.
